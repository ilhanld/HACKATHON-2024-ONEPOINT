## Explore biodiversity in Paris

One2Three is a web application developed during a 3-day hackathon (1.5 days of actual coding). The project highlights the richness of Parisian biodiversity through two main features:

An intelligent chatbot: powered by an AI, it uses open data from the data.gouv.fr API to answer questions about biodiversity in Paris.
An interactive map: this displays all the trees in Paris, enabling users to discover and explore the specific characteristics of these natural treasures.
